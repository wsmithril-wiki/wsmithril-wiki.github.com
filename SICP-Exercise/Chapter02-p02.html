<p>
The "Eight-Queens Puzzle" asks how to place eight queens on a chessboard so that
no queen is in check from any other (i.e., no two queens are in the same row,
column, or diagonal). One way to solve the puzzle is to work across the board,
placing a queen in each column. Once we have placed \(k-1\) queens, we must
place the \(k\)-th queen in a position where it does not check any of the queens
already on the board. We can formulate this approach recursively: Assume that
we have already generated the sequence of all possible ways to place
\(k-1\) queens in the first \(k-1\) columns of the board. For each of these ways,
generate an extended set of positions by placing a queen in each row of the \(k\)-th
column. Now filter these, keeping only the positions for which the queen in the
\(k\)-th column is safe with respect to the other queens. This produces the sequence
of all ways to place \(k\) queens in the first \(k\) columns. By continuing this
process, we will produce not only one solution, but all solutions to the
puzzle.
</p>

<p>
We implement this solution as a procedure queens, which returns a sequence of
all solutions to the problem of placing \(n\) queens on an \(n\times n\) chessboard. Queens
has an internal procedure <code>queen-cols</code> that returns the sequence of all ways to
place queens in the first \(k\) columns of the board.
</p>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define (queens board-size)
  (define (queen-cols k)
    (if (= k 0)
        (list empty-board)
        (filter
         (lambda (positions) (safe? k positions))
         (flatmap
          (lambda (rest-of-queens)
            (map (lambda (new-row)
                   (adjoin-position new-row k rest-of-queens))
                 (enumerate-interval 1 board-size)))
          (queen-cols (- k 1))))))
  (queen-cols board-size))
</pre>

<p>
In this procedure <code>rest-of-queens</code> is a way to place \(k-1\) queens in the first
\(k-1\) columns, and <code>new-row</code> is a proposed row in which to place the queen for the
\(k\)-th column. Complete the program by implementing the representation for sets of
board positions, including the procedure <code>adjoin-position</code>, which adjoins a new
<code>row-column</code> position to a set of positions, and <code>empty-board</code>, which represents an
empty set of positions. You must also write the procedure <code>safe?</code>, which
determines for a set of positions, whether the queen in the \(k\)-th column is safe
with respect to the others. (Note that we need only check whether the new queen
is safe -- the other queens are already guaranteed safe with respect to each
other.)

Answer:

</ul>

; an empty map has no queens

; the adjoint-position returns an list of k possible columns, having the k-th quene
; in the different possition

; is the board safe?
; since we already assume that the (k - 1) board is safe,
; we only need to test the last queen on the board
(define (safe? k cols)
    (define (all l) (accumulate (lambda (a b) (and a b)) #t l))
    (define (any l) (accumulate (lambda (a b) (or  a b)) #f l))
    (define (diag? col la)
        (define (iter i c ret)
            (if (null? c) ret
                (iter (+ i 1) (cdr c)

<p>
Louis Reasoner is having a terrible time doing exercise 2.42. His queens
procedure seems to work, but it runs extremely slowly. (Louis never does manage
to wait long enough for it to solve even the 6Ã—6 case.) When Louis asks Eva Lu
Ator for help, she points out that he has interchanged the order of the nested
mappings in the <code>flatmap</code>, writing it as
</p>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
(flatmap
 (lambda (new-row)
   (map (lambda (rest-of-queens)
          (adjoin-position new-row k rest-of-queens))
        (queen-cols (- k 1))))
 (enumerate-interval 1 board-size))
</pre>

<p>
Explain why this interchange makes the program run slowly. Estimate how long it
will take Louis's program to solve the eight-queens puzzle, assuming that the
program in exercise 2.42 solves the puzzle in time \(T\).
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

</ul>

<p>
First of all, the <code>queen</code> precedure will be running in the procedure <code>safe?</code>, so
the less times <code>safe?</code> being invoked, the less time will be used solving the
puzzle.
</p>

<p>
The former <code>flatmap</code> looks like this:
</p>
<pre class="brush: scheme">
(flatmap
  (lambda (rest-of-queens)
    (map (lambda (new-row)
           (adjoin-position new-row k rest-of-queens))
                 (enumerate-interval 1 board-size)))
  (queen-cols (- k 1)))
</pre>

<p>
For an 8x8 puzzle, this one will first emurate every 8x1 board with one quenee
on it, then append another column, try every possible combinations, filter out
unsafe ones, then append a third column... until all 8 quenes are on the board
safely. For an 8x8 board, 15720 times <code>safe?</code> will be invoked.
</p>

<p>
As for Louis's solution, with the two iterative flipped, this precedure solving
an 8x8 problem by solving every 7x8, 6x8, ..., 1x8 problem, append another
column, filter out "unsafe" ones, and return the result. Apperently, solving
6x8, 5x8, ..., 1x8 problems are not necessary here, and worese, this precedure
will try solve each of the 7x8, 6x8, ..., 1x8 problem in a same manner, that is
to solving 7x8 problem, it needs to solve 6x8, ..., 1x8 problems, and to solve
the 6x8 problem inside the 7x8 problem, it needs to solve 5x8, ..., 1x8
problems... That is why it seems take forever even when \(n\) is not too large.
</p>

<p>
The original solution is basicaly enumerate every possible position of queens on
the board, so it has an complacity of \(O(n^n)\) or \(O(n^{-\frac 12}n!)\). And with
the flipped iterative, solving a \(n\times n\) problem will result in solving each
smaller board in a full recursive manner, so the time complacity would be \(O(n^{n^n})\).
</p>

<p>
Here are some test: (measured in times of <code>safe?</code> invoked, this should be the
same in different implementations of <code>safe?</code>)

Two lists are said to be equal? if they contain equal elements arranged in the
same order. For example, <code>(equal? '(this is a list) '(this is a list))</code> is
true, but <code>(equal? '(this is a list) '(this (is a) list))</code> is false.

To be more precise, we can define <code>equal?</code> recursively in terms of the basic
<code>eq?</code> equality of symbols by saying that a and b are equal? if they are both
symbols and the symbols are <code>eq?</code>, or if they are both lists such that <code>(car a)</code> is

When you type <code>'abc</code> to the interpreter, the interpreter will return <code>(quote abc)</code>,

Extend the differentiation program to handle sums and products of arbitrary
numbers of (two or more) terms. Then the last example above could be expressed
as <code>(deriv '(* x y (+ x 3)) 'x)</code>.

Try to do this by changing only the
representation for <code>sums</code> and <code>products</code>, without changing the deriv procedure at
all. For example, the <code>addend</code> of a sum would be the first term, and the <code>augend</code>

<h3 id="toc_1.1.16">Exercise 2.58</h3>
<p>
Suppose we want to modify the differentiation program so that it works with
ordinary mathematical notation, in which <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> are infix rather than prefix
operators. Since the differentiation program is defined in terms of abstract
data, we can modify it to work with different representations of expressions
solely by changing the predicates, selectors, and constructors that define the
representation of the algebraic expressions on which the differentiator is to
operate.
</p>

<p>
a. Show how to do this in order to differentiate algebraic expressions presented
in infix form, such as <code>(x + (3 * (x + (y + 2))))</code>. To simplify the task, assume
that <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> always take two arguments and that expressions are fully
parenthesized.
</p>

<p>
b. The problem becomes substantially harder if we allow standard algebraic
notation, such as <code>(x + 3 * (x + y + 2))</code>, which drops unnecessary parentheses and
assumes that multiplication is done before addition. Can you design appropriate
predicates, selectors, and constructors for this notation such that our
derivative program still works?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

</ul>

<p>
a. With all proper parentheses in the expersion, it is an simple task.
</p>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define (make-sum e1 e2)
    (cond ((and (number? e1) (= e1 0)) e2)
          ((and (number? e2) (= e2 0)) e1)
          ((and (number? e1) (number? e2)) (+ e1 e2))
          (else (list e1 '+ e2))))
(define (sum? e) (eq? '+ (cadr e)))
(define addend car)
(define augend caddr)

(define (make-product e1 e2)
    (cond ((or (=number? e1 0) (=number? e2 0)) 0)
          ((and (number? e1) (number? e2)) (* e1 e2))
          ((=number? e1 1) e2)
          ((=number? e2 1) e1)
          (else (list e1 '* e2))))
(define (product? e) (eq? '* (cadr e)))
(define multiplier car)
(define multiplicand caddr)
</pre>

<p>
b. This one can be very complex. But here we only support two operation, <code>+</code> and
<code>*</code>, things will become much easier. Only need to change <code>augend</code> and
<code>multiplicand</code> in perivious exercise.
</p>

<p>
The idea is similiar to ex2.57, which is take the expersion as two part, the
first term, and the rest of it, without the operator in between. The only
different is we need to bundle the chain of <code>*</code> in <code>augend</code>, which basically trun
<code>2 + 3 * 4 * 5 + 6</code> into <code>2 + (3 * 4 * 5) + 6</code>, and then, the <code>(3 * 4 * 5)</code> can
be processed in trun. This is to avoid the complicity because of precedence and
take advantage of the language itself.
</p>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define (augend e)

We specified that a set would be represented as a list with no duplicates. Now
suppose we allow duplicates. For instance, the set <code>{1,2,3}</code> could be represented
as the list <code>(2 3 2 1 3 2 2)</code>. Design procedures <code>element-of-set?</code>, <code>adjoin-set</code>,
<code>union-set</code>, and <code>intersection-set</code> that operate on this representation. How does
the efficiency of each compare with the corresponding procedure for the
non-duplicate representation? Are there applications for which you would use
this representation in preference to the non-duplicate one?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

</ul>

<p>
The precedure <code>element-of-set</code> and <code>intersection-set</code> should remain same, only

Since there is no need to eliminate duplicate element, simply join two part of
the set will do.

<p>
As for efficiency, <code>unoin-set</code> and <code>adjoint-set</code> will significant faster than
non-duplicate representation. But while the set grow larger and with a lot of
duplicated element, <code>element-of-set?</code> and <code>intersect-set</code> will mush slower.

Do the two procedures have the same order of growth in the number of steps

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

</ul>

<p>
Since both <code>tree-&gt;list-1</code> and <code>tree-&gt;list-2</code> convert a tree into a list in
a "left-subtree, entry, right-subtree" way, which is an "inorder traversal"
path to an tree. All 3 trees in the figue returns the list <code>(1 3 5 7 9 11)</code>.
</p>

<p>
The different of times of list operation (Consider <code>cons</code> as 1 operation,
<code>append</code> a list at length of m considered m operations) used between the two
precedure is huge. <code>tree-&gt;list-2</code> take less operations, for it does not have
a lot of <code>append</code> and <code>cons</code> one element to the result on each node traversed.
So the <code>tree-&gt;list-2</code> has the order of list operation of \(O(n)\). While
<code>tree-&gt;list-1</code> has to append a list of right-subtree to left-subtree. So the
order of list operation would be \(O(n^2)\) for the most unbalanced tree, but
\(O(n{\rm log}n)\) for a balanced tree.

    ...
    &lt;==| left tree returns '(7 () ())

<p>
This is the same tree as the 3rd tree in the figure of last exercises.
</p>

<p>
Since this precedure calls <code>make-tree</code> and take of an element in the list each

n elements.

    ((repeat (- (length ps) 1) merge-1) ps))
</pre>

<p>
The inner precedure <code>merge-1</code> will merge the first two element together, and put
it back to a proper position in the list using <code>adjoin-set</code>. Repeat this step
n times for a list of n element will get a proper Huffman tree.

This is not as triky as Exercises 2.58. That one is really tricky.

<h3 id="toc_1.1.28">Exercise 2.70</h3>
<p>
The following eight-symbol alphabet with associated relative frequencies was
designed to efficiently encode the lyrics of 1950s rock songs. (Note that the
"symbols" of an "alphabet" need not be individual letters.)
</p>

<pre>
A     2   NA  16
BOOM  1   SHA  3
GET   2   YIP  9
JOB   2   WAH  1
</pre>

<p>
Use <code>generate-huffman-tree</code> (exercise 2.69) to generate a corresponding Huffman
tree, and use encode (exercise 2.68) to encode the following message:
</p>

<pre>
Get a job
Sha na na na na na na na na
Get a job
Sha na na na na na na na na
Wah yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip
Sha boom
</pre>

<p>
How many bits are required for the encoding? What is the smallest number of
bits that would be needed to encode this song if we used a fixed-length code
for the eight-symbol alphabet?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

</ul>

<p>
The Huffman encodings of this song takes 84 bits, the whole messege is
</p>
<pre>
111111100111101110000000001111111001111011100000000011010101010101010101010111011011
</pre>

<p>
But if we use a fix length encoding, each word needs 3-bit for each can encoding
8 different word. Therefore, 108 bits for the whole messege.
</p>


<h3 id="toc_1.1.29">Exercise 2.71</h3>
<p>
Suppose we have a Huffman tree for an alphabet of n symbols, and that the
relative frequencies of the symbols are 1, 2, 4, ..., \(2^{n-1}\). Sketch the
tree for n=5; for n=10. In such a tree (for general n) how many bits are
required to encode the most frequent symbol? the least frequent symbol?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

</ul>

<p>
Using symbol a-e to note the 5 symbols, the Huffman tree lookes like this:
</p>

<p>
<img src="/SICP-Exercise/image/ch02-p02-ex271-t1.svg" alt="n = 5" />
</p>

<p>
The tree when n=10 is similiar to n=5, but has more level. In gereral, to encode
the most frequent symbol alway takes 1 bit (simplily <code>0</code>), and n bits for the
least frequent symbol (<code>11...1</code>, n times 1).
</p>

<h3 id="toc_1.1.30">Exercise 2.72</h3>
<p>
Consider the encoding procedure that you designed in exercise 2.68. What is the
order of growth in the number of steps needed to encode a symbol? Be sure to
include the number of steps needed to search the symbol list at each node
encountered. To answer this question in general is difficult.  Consider the
special case where the relative frequencies of the n symbols are as described
in exercise 2.71, and give the order of growth (as a function of n) of the
number of steps needed to encode the most frequent and least frequent symbols
in the alphabet.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Answer: 

</ul>

<p>
If the distribution of symbols follows ex2.71, i.e. each symbol's occourance is
1, 2, 4, ..., \(2^{n-1}\), encoding the most frequent symbol takes \(O(1)\) step,
while \(O(n)\) for the least frequent symbol. If we consider the ocourance of each
symbol into account, to encode a message at length of n will takes 
\(n\sum_{i=1}^n i\times\frac{2^{i-1}}{2^n-1}\) steps in average, which is
surprisingly less then \(4n\) for every \(n\ge3\), even irrelvent to the size of
alphbet.

<h3 id="toc_1.1.31">Exercise 2.73</h3>
<p>
Section 2.3.2 described a program that performs symbolic differentiation:
</p>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define (deriv exp var)
  (cond ((number? exp) 0)
        ((variable? exp) (if (same-variable? exp var) 1 0))
        ((sum? exp)
         (make-sum (deriv (addend exp) var)
                   (deriv (augend exp) var)))
        ((product? exp)
         (make-sum
           (make-product (multiplier exp)
                         (deriv (multiplicand exp) var))
           (make-product (deriv (multiplier exp) var)
                         (multiplicand exp))))
        ;&lt;more rules can be added here&gt;
        (else (error "unknown expression type -- DERIV" exp))))
</pre>

<p>
We can regard this program as performing a dispatch on the type of the
expression to be differentiated. In this situation the "type tag" of the datum
is the algebraic operator symbol (such as <code>+</code>) and the operation being performed
is <code>deriv</code>. We can transform this program into <code>data-directed</code> style by rewriting
the basic derivative procedure as:
</p>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define (deriv exp var)
   (cond ((number? exp) 0)
         ((variable? exp) (if (same-variable? exp var) 1 0))
         (else ((get 'deriv (operator exp)) (operands exp)
                                            var))))
(define (operator exp) (car exp))
(define (operands exp) (cdr exp))
</pre>

<ol>
<li>
Explain what was done above. Why can't we assimilate the predicates number?
  and <code>same-variable?</code> into the data-directed dispatch?

</ol>

<ol>
<li>
Write the procedures for derivatives of sums and products, and the
  auxiliary code required to install them in the table used by the program above.

</ol>

<ol>
<li>
Choose any additional differentiation rule that you like, such as the one
  for exponents (exercise 2.56), and install it in this data-directed system.

</ol>

<ol>
<li>
In this simple algebraic manipulator the type of an expression is the
  algebraic operator that binds it together. Suppose, however, we indexed the
  procedures in the opposite way, so that the dispatch line in deriv looked like

</ol>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
((get (operator exp) 'deriv) (operands exp) var)
</pre>

<p>
What corresponding changes to the derivative system are required? 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

</ul>

<p>
The reason for <code>number?</code> and <code>same-variable</code> can't assimilated into
data-directed dispatch is they are dealing with data without data-tag. 
</p>

<p>
The precedure to derives sum and product looks likes this:
</p>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define (deriv-add expr) 
    (make-sum (deriv (addend expr))
              (deriv (augend expr))))
(define (deriv-prod expr)
    (let ((exp1 (multiplicand expr))
          (exp2 (multiplication expr)))
    (make-sum (make-product exp1 (deriv exp2))
              (make-product exp2 (deriv exp1)))))
(put 'deriv '(+) deriv-add)
(put 'deriv '(*) deriv-prod)
</pre>

<p>
Add exponent to <code>deriv</code>. Using precedures in previous exercises.
</p>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define (deriv-exponent expr)
    (make-product
        (exponent expr)
        (make-product (make-exponentiation (base expr) (- (exponent expr) 1))
                      (deriv (base expr) var))))
</pre>

<p>
If we want to use dispatch line like <code>((get (operator exp) 'deriv) (operands exp) var)))</code>,
we need to implement <code>operator</code> and <code>operands</code> precedures.
</p>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define operator car)
(define operands (lambda (x) x))

<h3 id="toc_1.1.32">Exercise 2.74</h3>
<p>
Insatiable Enterprises, Inc., is a highly decentralized conglomerate company
consisting of a large number of independent divisions located all over the
world. The company's computer facilities have just been interconnected by means
of a clever network-interfacing scheme that makes the entire network appear to
any user to be a single computer. Insatiable's president, in her first attempt
to exploit the ability of the network to extract administrative information
from division files, is dismayed to discover that, although all the division
files have been implemented as data structures in Scheme, the particular data
structure used varies from division to division. A meeting of division managers
is hastily called to search for a strategy to integrate the files that will
satisfy headquarters' needs while preserving the existing autonomy of the
divisions.
</p>

<p>
Show how such a strategy can be implemented with data-directed programming. As
an example, suppose that each division's personnel records consist of a single
file, which contains a set of records keyed on employees' names. The structure
of the set varies from division to division. Furthermore, each employee's
record is itself a set (structured differently from division to division) that
contains information keyed under identifiers such as address and salary. In
particular:
</p>

<p>
a.  Implement for headquarters a <code>get-record</code> procedure that retrieves a
specified employee's record from a specified personnel file. The procedure
should be applicable to any division's file. Explain how the individual 
divisions' files should be structured. In particular, what type information
must be supplied?
</p>

<p>
b.  Implement for headquarters a <code>get-salary</code> procedure that returns the salary
information from a given employee's record from any division's personnel file.
How should the record be structured in order to make this operation work?
</p>

<p>
c.  Implement for headquarters a <code>find-employee-record</code> procedure. This should
search all the divisions' files for the record of a given employee and return
the record. Assume that this procedure takes as arguments an employee's name
and a list of all the divisions' files.
</p>

<p>
d.  When Insatiable takes over a new company, what changes must be made in
order to incorporate the new personnel information into the central system? 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

</ul>

<p>
Short answer, how the files structured in each division dose not matter much,
as long as it suits the needs of each division. The HQ may holds a list of all
personnel, detailing which division each personnel belongs, and syncronize it
with each division on every personnel changes. When the HQ calls <code>get-record</code>,
it looks up in the personnel list, knowing which division to querry, and then
send a request to the coresponding division. The division get this request,
doing theri local search, and return thr record in a unified format, meaning
each division shall implement their own constrotor, but returns a same
representation. Then <code>get-salary</code> shall just extract the information from the
record as a selector. <code>find-employee-record</code> works like a <code>filter-map</code>, like 
</p>
<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define (find-employee-record name)
    (map get-record (filter (lambda (x) (eq? name x)) employee-name-list)))
</pre>
<p>
shall do. 
</p>

<p>
Adding a new division is simple in this design. Just implement the constrotor
for record locally, and an interface to process requests come from HQ, and
return the record. Then syncronize the employee list to HQ.
</p>

<p>
The most tricky part in this design is how to syncronize the employee list. This
is indeed a very complex problem cannot be avoided in a distributed system.

<p>
As a large system with generic operations evolves, new types of data objects or
new operations may be needed. For each of the three strategies -- generic
operations with explicit dispatch, data-directed style, and
message-passing-style -- describe the changes that must be made to a system in
order to add new types or new operations. Which organization would be most
appropriate for a system in which new types must often be added? Which would be
most appropriate for a system in which new operations must often be added?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

</ul>

<p>
Add a new operation to the system when using explicit dispatch need to modified all
involved precedure, adding approperated branches. This method need huge amount
of work, and will affect exisiting code in an unpredicatable way (introducing
new bug, forget some branches, recurssion, etc.). The same thing happens when we
add a new type to the system. This really sucks.
</p>

<p>
In data-directed style program, we will only need insert new implement into
global add to the system, which means whatever we want to add to the system, we
can simplily append the source to the original source without touching any
already exisiting source, which makes it the most simple way to add new feature
of old system. But all these come with a price, for in a large system, the
dispatch table can be huge. This will resulting in a big overhead when the
dispatcher lookup in the table, and find the which precedure to call. Also,
dealing the tag in data can also have a tiny overhead. And we still need to
worry about name comflict, but dealing with it is much easier in comperison to
explicit dispatch style. This is the best way foe system with bunch of "fixed"
precedure, but need to add new type often.
</p>

<p>
Message passing comes in the middle. We need add new branches into all
involving precedure when adding new types, lots of work, but less than explicit
dispatch. Adding new precedure is much easier, only need to implement them.
But we do not have to worry about name comflict at all, for everything is in
a closure. And this style does not have the overhead of looking up the dispatch
table and deal with the tag in the data. This is the best way for a system needs
new operations must often be added, and need convertions between types often.
