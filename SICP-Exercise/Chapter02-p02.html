<p>
The "Eight-Queens Puzzle" asks how to place eight queens on a chessboard so that
no queen is in check from any other (i.e., no two queens are in the same row,
column, or diagonal). One way to solve the puzzle is to work across the board,
placing a queen in each column. Once we have placed \(k-1\) queens, we must
place the \(k\)-th queen in a position where it does not check any of the queens
already on the board. We can formulate this approach recursively: Assume that
we have already generated the sequence of all possible ways to place
\(k-1\) queens in the first \(k-1\) columns of the board. For each of these ways,
generate an extended set of positions by placing a queen in each row of the \(k\)-th
column. Now filter these, keeping only the positions for which the queen in the
\(k\)-th column is safe with respect to the other queens. This produces the sequence
of all ways to place \(k\) queens in the first \(k\) columns. By continuing this
process, we will produce not only one solution, but all solutions to the
puzzle.
</p>

<p>
We implement this solution as a procedure queens, which returns a sequence of
all solutions to the problem of placing \(n\) queens on an \(n\times n\) chessboard. Queens
has an internal procedure <code>queen-cols</code> that returns the sequence of all ways to
place queens in the first \(k\) columns of the board.
</p>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define (queens board-size)
  (define (queen-cols k)
    (if (= k 0)
        (list empty-board)
        (filter
         (lambda (positions) (safe? k positions))
         (flatmap
          (lambda (rest-of-queens)
            (map (lambda (new-row)
                   (adjoin-position new-row k rest-of-queens))
                 (enumerate-interval 1 board-size)))
          (queen-cols (- k 1))))))
  (queen-cols board-size))
</pre>

<p>
In this procedure <code>rest-of-queens</code> is a way to place \(k-1\) queens in the first
\(k-1\) columns, and <code>new-row</code> is a proposed row in which to place the queen for the
\(k\)-th column. Complete the program by implementing the representation for sets of
board positions, including the procedure <code>adjoin-position</code>, which adjoins a new
<code>row-column</code> position to a set of positions, and <code>empty-board</code>, which represents an
empty set of positions. You must also write the procedure <code>safe?</code>, which
determines for a set of positions, whether the queen in the \(k\)-th column is safe
with respect to the others. (Note that we need only check whether the new queen
is safe -- the other queens are already guaranteed safe with respect to each
other.)

Answer:

</ul>

; an empty map has no queens

; the adjoint-position returns an list of k possible columns, having the k-th quene
; in the different possition

; is the board safe?
; since we already assume that the (k - 1) board is safe,
; we only need to test the last queen on the board
(define (safe? k cols)
    (define (all l) (accumulate (lambda (a b) (and a b)) #t l))
    (define (any l) (accumulate (lambda (a b) (or  a b)) #f l))
    (define (diag? col la)
        (define (iter i c ret)
            (if (null? c) ret
                (iter (+ i 1) (cdr c)

<p>
Louis Reasoner is having a terrible time doing exercise 2.42. His queens
procedure seems to work, but it runs extremely slowly. (Louis never does manage
to wait long enough for it to solve even the 6Ã—6 case.) When Louis asks Eva Lu
Ator for help, she points out that he has interchanged the order of the nested
mappings in the <code>flatmap</code>, writing it as
</p>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
(flatmap
 (lambda (new-row)
   (map (lambda (rest-of-queens)
          (adjoin-position new-row k rest-of-queens))
        (queen-cols (- k 1))))
 (enumerate-interval 1 board-size))
</pre>

<p>
Explain why this interchange makes the program run slowly. Estimate how long it
will take Louis's program to solve the eight-queens puzzle, assuming that the
program in exercise 2.42 solves the puzzle in time \(T\).
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

</ul>

<p>
First of all, the <code>queen</code> precedure will be running in the procedure <code>safe?</code>, so
the less times <code>safe?</code> being invoked, the less time will be used solving the
puzzle.
</p>

<p>
The former <code>flatmap</code> looks like this:
</p>
<pre class="brush: scheme">
(flatmap
  (lambda (rest-of-queens)
    (map (lambda (new-row)
           (adjoin-position new-row k rest-of-queens))
                 (enumerate-interval 1 board-size)))
  (queen-cols (- k 1)))
</pre>

<p>
For an 8x8 puzzle, this one will first emurate every 8x1 board with one quenee
on it, then append another column, try every possible combinations, filter out
unsafe ones, then append a third column... until all 8 quenes are on the board
safely. For an 8x8 board, 15720 times <code>safe?</code> will be invoked.
</p>

<p>
As for Louis's solution, with the two iterative flipped, this precedure solving
an 8x8 problem by solving every 7x8, 6x8, ..., 1x8 problem, append another
column, filter out "unsafe" ones, and return the result. Apperently, solving
6x8, 5x8, ..., 1x8 problems are not necessary here, and worese, this precedure
will try solve each of the 7x8, 6x8, ..., 1x8 problem in a same manner, that is
to solving 7x8 problem, it needs to solve 6x8, ..., 1x8 problems, and to solve
the 6x8 problem inside the 7x8 problem, it needs to solve 5x8, ..., 1x8
problems... That is why it seems take forever even when \(n\) is not too large.
</p>

<p>
The original solution is basicaly enumerate every possible position of queens on
the board, so it has an complacity of \(O(n^n)\) or \(O(n^{-\frac 12}n!)\). And with
the flipped iterative, solving a \(n\times n\) problem will result in solving each
smaller board in a full recursive manner, so the time complacity would be \(O(n^{n^n})\).
</p>

<p>
Here are some test: (measured in times of <code>safe?</code> invoked, this should be the
same in different implementations of <code>safe?</code>)

Two lists are said to be equal? if they contain equal elements arranged in the
same order. For example, <code>(equal? '(this is a list) '(this is a list))</code> is
true, but <code>(equal? '(this is a list) '(this (is a) list))</code> is false.

To be more precise, we can define <code>equal?</code> recursively in terms of the basic
<code>eq?</code> equality of symbols by saying that a and b are equal? if they are both
symbols and the symbols are <code>eq?</code>, or if they are both lists such that <code>(car a)</code> is

When you type <code>'abc</code> to the interpreter, the interpreter will return <code>(quote abc)</code>,

Extend the differentiation program to handle sums and products of arbitrary
numbers of (two or more) terms. Then the last example above could be expressed
as <code>(deriv '(* x y (+ x 3)) 'x)</code>.
</p>

<p>
Try to do this by changing only the
representation for <code>sums</code> and <code>products</code>, without changing the deriv procedure at
all. For example, the <code>addend</code> of a sum would be the first term, and the <code>augend</code>
would be the sum of the rest of the terms. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

</ul>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
; sum
(define (make-sum . e)
    (let ((numbers (fold + 0 (filter (lambda (x) (number? x)) e)))
          (vars (filter (lambda (x) (not (number? x))) e)))
    (cond ((= 0 numbers)
        (cond ((null? vars) 0)
              ((null? (cdr vars)) (car vars))
              (else (cons '+ vars))))
          (else (cond ((null? vars) numbers)
                      (else (cons '+ (cons numbers vars))))))))
(define addend cadr)
(define (augend e)
    (let ((aug (cddr e)))
    (if (null? (cdr aug)) (car aug) (cons '+ aug))))

; products
(define (make-prouct . e)
    (let ((numbers (fold * 1 (filter (lambda (x) (number? x)) e)))
          (vars (filter (lambda (x) (not (number? x))) e)))
    (cond ((= 0 numbers) 0)
          ((= 1 numbers) (cond ((null? vars) 1)
                               ((null? (cdr vars)) (car vars))
                               (else (cons '+ vars))))
          (else (cond ((null? vars) numbers)
                      (else (cons '+ (cons numbers vars))))))))
(define multiplier cadr)
(define (multiplicand e)
    (let ((aug (cddr e)))
    (if (null? (cdr aug)) (car aug) (cons '* aug))))
</pre>

<p>
One more thing, without a proper simplifier, the result is pretty messed up, and
no sane soul will write some thing like this:
</p>
<pre class="brush: scheme">
]=&gt; (deriv '( * x x x x y) 'x)
    (+ (* x (+ (* x (+ (* x y) (* x y))) (* x x y))) (* x x x y))
</pre>
<p>
This is indeed the correct answer, but badly shaped.
</p>

<h3 id="toc_1.2.14">Exercise 2.58</h3>
<p>
Suppose we want to modify the differentiation program so that it works with
ordinary mathematical notation, in which <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> are infix rather than prefix
operators. Since the differentiation program is defined in terms of abstract
data, we can modify it to work with different representations of expressions
solely by changing the predicates, selectors, and constructors that define the
representation of the algebraic expressions on which the differentiator is to
operate.
</p>

<p>
a. Show how to do this in order to differentiate algebraic expressions presented
in infix form, such as <code>(x + (3 * (x + (y + 2))))</code>. To simplify the task, assume
that <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> always take two arguments and that expressions are fully
parenthesized.
</p>

<p>
b. The problem becomes substantially harder if we allow standard algebraic
notation, such as <code>(x + 3 * (x + y + 2))</code>, which drops unnecessary parentheses and
assumes that multiplication is done before addition. Can you design appropriate
predicates, selectors, and constructors for this notation such that our
derivative program still works? 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

</ul>

<p>
a. With all proper parentheses in the expersion, it is an simple task.
</p>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define (make-sum e1 e2) 
    (cond ((and (number? e1) (= e1 0)) e2)
          ((and (number? e2) (= e2 0)) e1)
          ((and (number? e1) (number? e2)) (+ e1 e2))
          (else (list e1 '+ e2))))
(define (sum? e) (eq? '+ (cadr e)))
(define addend car)
(define augend caddr)

(define (make-product e1 e2)
    (cond ((or (=number? e1 0) (=number? e2 0)) 0)
          ((and (number? e1) (number? e2)) (* e1 e2))
          ((=number? e1 1) e2)
          ((=number? e2 1) e1)
          (else (list e1 '* e2))))
(define (product? e) (eq? '* (cadr e)))
(define multiplier car)
(define multiplicand caddr)
</pre>

<p>
b. This one can be very complex. But here we only support two operation, <code>+</code> and
<code>*</code>, things will become much easier. Only need to change <code>augend</code> and
<code>multiplicand</code> in perivious exercise.
</p>

<p>
The idea is similiar to ex2.57, which is take the expersion as two part, the
first term, and the rest of it, without the operator in between. The only
different is we need to bundle the chain of <code>*</code> in <code>augend</code>, which basically trun 
<code>2 + 3 * 4 * 5 + 6</code> into <code>2 + (3 * 4 * 5) + 6</code>, and then, the <code>(3 * 4 * 5)</code> can
be processed in trun. This is to avoid the complicity because of precedence and
take advantage of the language itself.
</p>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define (augend e)
    ; the most complex part, need to bundle next chain of * into a list
    ; i.e. trun upcoming 4 * 5 * 6 + 7 to (4 * 5 * 6) + 7
    (define (helper in bundle)
        (let ((e  (car in))
              (es (cdr in)))
        (cond ((null? es) (if (null? bundle) e (append bundle (list '* e))))
              ((eq? (car es) '*) 
                (if (null? bundle) (helper (cdr es) (list e))
                    (helper (cdr es) (append bundle (list '* e)))))
              (else 
                (if (null? bundle) in 
                    (append (list (append bundle (list '* e))) es))))))
    (let ((t (cddr e)))
    (cond ((pair? (car t)) (car t))
          (else (helper t '())))))

; no need to bundle anything here, for * has the hiest precedence in this
; exercises
(define (multiplicand e)
    (cond ((pair? (caddr e)) (caddr e))
          (else (cddr e))))
