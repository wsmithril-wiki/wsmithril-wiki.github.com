= The Newton's Method =
Newton's Method is a quick way to guess a root of an equation, simle follow the
simple iteration rule folloews:
- Pick $x_0$,
- Then do the iteration
{{$
    x_{n} = x_{n-1} - \frac{f(x_{n-1})}{f'(x_{n-1}))}
}}$

Then, when $n\to\infty$, ${x_n}$ will convergence under some condition, 

let $x^{*}=\lim\nolimits_{n\to\infty}x_n$, then we have $f(x^{*}) = 0$

== Convergence ==
According to `Taylor's theorem`, if $x^{*}$ is the root of $f(x)$, the expansion
of $f(x^*)$ about $x$ is:
{{$
f(x^*)=f(x)+f'(x)(x^*-x)+\frac{1}{2}f''(\xi)(x^*-x)^2, (x^*-\xi)(x-\xi) < 0
}}$
Dividing by $f'(x)$ and rearrange:
{{$
\frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}+(x^*-x) = - \frac{1}{2} \frac{f''(\xi)}{f'(x)} (x^*-x)^2
}}$
Denote that $\epsilon_n=x^*-x_n$, and let $x=x_n$, this become:
{{$
\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} - x_n + x^* = - \frac{1}{2} \frac{f''(\xi)}{f'(x_n)}(x^*-x_n)^2
}}$
Notice that $x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)$,
{{$
\epsilon_{n+1} = - \frac{1}{2} \frac{f''(\xi)}{f'(x_n)}\epsilon_n^2
}}$
Take the absolute value gives:
{{$
\left|\epsilon_{n-1}\right|=\frac{1}{2}\left|\frac{f''(\xi)}{f'(x_n)}\epsilon_n^2 \right|
}}$
And this shows (at least):
- The iteration of ${x_n}$ will converge under these condition:
  # $f''$ is _limited_ in interval $I$;
  # $f'$ is non-zero in interval $I$;
  # the initial value$x_0$ is "close enough" to the root $x^*$, or will get close
    eonugh after a finite times of iteration.
- The rate of convergence is quadratic. And this makes the Newton's method can
  converge even if there is a rounding error in each step.

Here $I$ is an interval $[x^*-r, x^*+r]$ for some $r>(x_0 - x^*)$

How close is "close enough", that is, if denoted $M=\sup_{x\in I} \left|\frac{f''(x)}{f'(x)}\right|$, $\left|x_0-x^*\right|M<1$
