Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators
are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of
the following procedure:
</p>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (&gt; b 0) + -) a b))

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

<ul>
<li>
When <code>(&gt; b 0)</code> evaluated true, <code>(a-plus-abs-b a b) </code> become <code>(- a b)</code>,
    since \(b &lt; 0\) , this means \(a+\left|b\right|\)

When <code>(&gt; b 0)</code> evaluated false, it is <code>(+ a b)</code> now, again, means
    \(a+\left|b\right|\)

<p>
Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is
faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation.
He defines the following two procedures:
</p>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))
</pre>

<p>
Then he evaluates the expression
</p>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
(test 0 (p))
</pre>

<p>
What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order
evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses
normal-order evaluation? Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule
for the special form <code>if</code> is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or
applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first, and the result
determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.)
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

<ul>
<li>
In an interpreter uses applicative-order eval., <code>(test 0 (p))</code> will first be
    expanded to <code>(if (= 0 0) 0 p)</code>, then goes to its first branch and than the
    whole expression is evaluated to 0

<li>
But in an interpreter uses normal-order eval., <code>(test 0 (p))</code> will also be
    expanded to <code>(if (= 0 0) 0 p)</code>, but than, the interpreter try to expend
    the nested <code>(p)</code>, and found it should be expand to <code>(p)</code>. Again, the
    interpreter will still try to expand <code>p</code> here, so the whole evaluation will
    never terminate.

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Alyssa P. Hacker doesn't see why if needs to be provided as a special form.
"Why can't I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of <code>cond?</code>" she
asks. Alyssa's friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she
defines a new version of <code>if</code>:
</p>
<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))
</pre>
<p>
Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:
</p>
<pre class="brush: scheme">
(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
5

(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
0
</pre>
<p>
Delighted, Alyssa uses <code>new-if</code> to rewrite the square-root program:
</p>
<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
           guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                     x)))
</pre>
<p>
What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots? Explain.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

</ul>

<p>
The computation of square will never terminate. In an normal-order interpreter,
the recursion will never end, as already seen in <a href="\#toc_1.2.5.html">previous</a>
exercise. Still, even in a applicative-order interpreter, use <code>new-if</code> will not
always ensure the recursion terminate.
</p>

<p>
When the interpreter try to eval the <code>sqrt</code>, it will come across the `(new-if
(good-enough? ...) guess (sqrt-iter ...))`. Here, the interpreter will eval.
<code>(good-enough? ...)</code>, <code>guess</code>, <code>(sqrt-iter ...)</code> accordingly. And when
evaluating <code>iter-iter</code>, it will come across the new-if again. This means the
evaluation will never terminate.
</p>

<p>
The difference between between the 'internal' <code>if</code> and the <code>new-if</code> is that the
internal <code>if</code> is a primitive instruction, its evaluation process differs from
normal procedure. <code>if</code> will evaluate <code>predicate</code> first, and then only evaluate
one of <code>then-clause</code> and <code>else-clause</code> on <code>predicate</code> result, which the <code>new-if</code>
failed when evaluating a recursive procedure.
</p>

<h3 id="toc_1.1.7">Exercise 1.7</h3>

<p>
The <code>good-enough?</code> test used in computing square roots will not be very effective
for finding the square roots of very small numbers. Also, in real computers,
arithmetic operations are almost always performed with limited precision. This
makes our test inadequate for very large numbers. Explain these statements, with
examples showing how the test fails for small and large numbers. An alternative
strategy for implementing <code>good-enough?</code> is to watch how guess changes from one
iteration to the next and to stop when the change is a very small fraction of
the guess. Design a square-root procedure that uses this kind of end test. Does
this work better for small and large numbers?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

</ul>

<p>
Suppose we want to find the square root of 10<sup><small>10</small></sup>, which is 10<sup><small>5</small></sup>, the evaluation
go on like this:
<table>
<tr>
<th>
guess
</th>
<th>
x/guess
</th>
<th>
avg.
</th>
<th>
abs(avg<sup><small>2</small></sup>-x)
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
1
</td>
<td>
1<sup><small>-10</small></sup>
</td>
<td>
1 + 5*10<sup><small>-11</small></sup>
</td>
<td>
nearly 10<sup><small>10</small></sup> - 1
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
1 + 5*10<sup><small>-11</small></sup>
</td>
<td>
0.999*10<sup><small>-10</small></sup>
</td>
<td>
1 + 9.99*10<sup><small>-11</small></sup>
</td>
<td>
nearly 10<sup><small>10</small></sup> - 1
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
...
</td>
<td>
...
</td>
<td>
...
</td>
<td>
...
</td>
</tr>
</table>
As we can see here, the evaluation converges slowly, in fact, it will <strong>never</strong>
converges since the difference <code>avg.</code> is always a number slightly large than 1,
and their difference is too small in comparison of 10<sup><small>10</small></sup> and may be rounded
off. So the eval will fail on large number.
</p>

<p>
The case with very small number is better, the evaluation will terminate, but
with a wrong value. This is mainly caused by the way with the definition of
<code>good-enough?</code>. When the <code>guess</code> itself is smaller than the threshold in
<code>good-enough?</code>, the iteration will terminate, whatever it is the proper square
root.
</p>

<p>
Using change between two guess as the termination condition, the
<code>good-enugh?</code> may look like:
</p>
<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define TOL 0.00001)
(define (good-enough? old-guess guess)
        (if (= guess 0)
            true
            (&lt; (abs (/ (- guess old-guess) guess)) TOL)))
</pre>
<p>
And <code>sqrt-iter</code> should modify accordingly:
</p>
<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
    ((define old-guess guess)
     (define new-guess (improve guess x)
        (if (good-enough? old-guess new-guess)
            old-guess
            (sqrt-iter new-guess x)))
</pre>
<p>
And this version of <code>good-enough?</code> will terminate on large number, with a wrong
answer, but good with small number. The poor condition with large number is
majorly the restriction of Newton's method, which means there nothing else to do
to improve the problem with large number without a better way to find the
initial guess value, other thane simply take 1.

<h3 id="toc_1.1.8">Exercise 2.8</h3>
<p>
Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if \(y\) is
an approximation to the cube root of \(x\), then a better approximation is given by
the value
</p>
\[
y^*=\frac{x/y^2 + 2y}{3}
\]
<p>
Use this formula to implement a <code>cube-root</code> procedure analogous to the square-root
procedure. (In section 1.3.4 we will see how to implement Newton's method in
general as an abstraction of these square-root and cube-root procedures.)

Prove that \(Fib(n)\) is the closest integer to \(\varphi^n/\sqrt{5}\), where

The induction definition of <code>Fibonacci numbers</code>, say \(Fib(n)=Fib(n-1)+Fib(n-2)\),

<li>
Since each call of <code>p</code> will decrease the angle to its one-third, and
    12.15 is 0.05*3<sup><small>5</small></sup>, in the evaluation of <code>(sine 12.15)</code>, <code>p</code> will be applied

The exponentiation algorithms in this section are based on performing
exponentiation by means of repeated multiplication. In a similar way, one can
perform integer multiplication by means of repeated addition. The following
multiplication procedure (in which it is assumed that our language can only add,
not multiply) is analogous to the <code>expt</code> procedure:

There is a clever algorithm for computing the Fibonacci numbers in a logarithmic
number of steps. Recall the transformation of the state variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> in
the <code>fib-iter</code> process of section 1.2.2: \((a,a+b)\) and \((b,a)\). Call this
transformation \(T\), and observe that applying \(T\) over and over again n times,
starting with 1 and 0, produces the pair <code>Fib(n + 1)</code> and <code>Fib(n)</code>. In other
words, the Fibonacci numbers are produced by applying \(T^n\), the nth power of the
transformation \(T\), starting with the pair \((1,0)\). Now consider \(T\) to be the
special case of \(p=0\) and \(q=1\) in a family of transformations \(T_{pq}\), where
\(T_{pq}\) transforms the pair \((a,b)\) according to \((a,bq+aq+ap)\) and
\((b,bp+aq)\). Show that if we apply such a transformation \(T_{pq}\) twice, the
effect is the same as using a single transformation \(T_{p'q'}\) of the same form,
and compute \(p'\) and \(q'\) in terms of \(p\) and \(q\). This gives us an explicit way
to square these transformations, and thus we can compute Tn using successive
squaring, as in the <code>fast-expt</code> procedure. Put this all together to complete the
following procedure, which runs in a logarithmic number of steps:

The process that a procedure generates is of course dependent on the rules used

if is described in exercise 1.5.) Using the substitution method (for normal
order), illustrate the process generated in evaluating <code>(gcd 206 40)</code> and indicate
the remainder operations that are actually performed. How many remainder
operations are actually performed in the normal-order evaluation of <code>(gcd 206 40)</code>?

Most Lisp implementations include a primitive called <code>runtime</code> that returns an

(measured, for example, in microseconds). The following <code>timed-prime-test</code>
procedure, when called with an integer <code>n</code>, prints <code>n</code> and checks to see if <code>n</code> is
prime. If <code>n</code> is prime, the procedure prints three asterisks followed by the
amount of time used in performing the test.

Using this procedure, write a procedure <code>search-for-primes</code> that checks the

Since the testing algorithm has order of growth of \(O(\sqrt{n})\), you should expect that
testing for primes around 10,000 should take about 10 times as long as testing
for primes around 1000. Do your timing data bear this out? How well do the data

The <code>smallest-divisor</code> procedure shown at the start of this section does lots of
needless testing: After it checks to see if the number is divisible by 2 there
is no point in checking to see if it is divisible by any larger even numbers.
This suggests that the values used for <code>test-divisor</code> should not be 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, ..., but rather 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, .... To implement this change, define
a procedure next that returns 3 if its input is equal to 2 and otherwise
returns its input plus 2. Modify the <code>smallest-divisor</code> procedure to use
<code>(next test-divisor)</code> instead of <code>(+ test-divisor 1)</code>. With <code>timed-prime-test</code>
incorporating this modified version of <code>smallest-divisor</code>, run the test for each

This version of <code>expmod</code> will indeed faster then original <code>expmod</code> with small
<code>base</code> and <code>exp</code>, for it shall only eval <code>remainder</code> once. But with a larger
<code>base</code> and/or <code>exp</code>, this <code>expmod</code> will much slower and may even yield the wrong
answer, simply for the <code>(fast-expt base exp)</code> will be quite a large number, so
either the calculation large number with precision involved here, which is known
to be very slow, or just simply overflowed, which leads to the wrong answer.

Lu Ator over to help. When they examine Louis's code, they find that he has
rewritten the <code>expmod</code> procedure to use an explicit multiplication, rather than
calling square:
</p>

<pre class="bursh: scheme">
(define (expmod base exp m)
  (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
        ((even? exp)
         (remainder (* (expmod base (/ exp 2) m)
                       (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))
                    m))

"I don't see what difference that could make," says Louis. "I do." says Eva.
"By writing the procedure like that, you have transformed the \(O(\log n)\) process
into a \(O(n)\) process." Explain.

<ul>

Answer:

</ul>

<p>
The original <code>expmode</code> use <code>square</code> to reduce the calling of <code>expmode</code>, which
the modified version has failed. With an even base, the modified <code>expmod</code> will
call itself twice. By doing so, the modified <code>expmod</code> makes no difference than
simply multiply <code>base</code> with itself <code>exp</code> times, but with the overhead of
recursive calling, which makes the <code>prime?</code> even slower.

One variant of the Fermat test that cannot be fooled is called the
<code>Miller-Rabin test</code> (Miller 1976; Rabin 1980). This starts from an alternate
form of <code>Fermat's Little Theorem</code>, which states that if \(n\) is a prime number and
\(a\) is any positive integer less than \(n\), then \(a\) raised to the \((n - 1)\)st power is
congruent to 1 modulo \(n\). To test the primality of a number \(n\) by the <code>Miller-Rabin</code>
test, we pick a random number \(a &lt; n\) and raise \(a\) to the \((n - 1)\)st power modulo
\(n\) using the <code>expmod</code> procedure. However, whenever we perform the squaring step in
<code>expmod</code>, we check to see if we have discovered a "nontrivial square root of
1 modulo \(n\)," that is, a number not equal to 1 or \(n - 1\) whose square is equal to
1 modulo \(n\).  It is possible to prove that if such a nontrivial square root of
1 exists, then \(n\) is not prime. It is also possible to prove that if \(n\) is an odd
number that is not prime, then, for at least half the numbers \(a&lt;n\), computing
an-1 in this way will reveal a nontrivial square root of 1 modulo \(n\). (This is
why the Miller-Rabin test cannot be fooled.) Modify the <code>expmod</code> procedure to
signal if it discovers a nontrivial square root of 1, and use this to implement
the Miller-Rabin test with a procedure analogous to <code>fermat-test</code>. Check your
procedure by testing various known primes and non-primes. Hint: One convenient
way to make <code>expmod</code> signal is to have it return 0.

You can obtain an even more general version of <code>accumulate</code> (exercise 1.32) by
introducing the notion of a <code>filter</code> on the terms to be combined. That is, combine
only those terms derived from values in the range that satisfy a specified
condition. The resulting <code>filtered-accumulate</code> abstraction takes the same
arguments as accumulate, together with an additional predicate of one argument
that specifies the filter. Write <code>filtered-accumulate</code> as a procedure. Show how to
express the following using <code>filtered-accumulate</code>:
</p>

<p>
a. The sum of the squares of the prime numbers in the interval a to b (assuming
that you have a prime? <code>predicate</code> already written)
</p>

<p>
b. The product of all the positive integers less than n that are relatively
prime to n (i.e., all positive integers \(i &lt; n\) such that \(\rm{GCD}(i,n) = 1\)). 
</p>

<p>
Show that the golden ratio \(\phi\) (section 1.2.2) is a fixed point of the
transformation \(x \mapsto 1 + \frac 1x\), and use this fact to compute by means of the
fixed-point procedure. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

</ul>
<p>
From the definition of \(\phi = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{f_{n+1}}{f_n}\),
where \(f_n\) is the n-th term of <code>Fibonacci Sequence</code>, since \(\phi &gt; 0\), 
</p>
\[
1+\frac 1\phi =1 + 1 / \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{f_{n+1}}{f_n}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{f_n+f_{n+1}}{f_{n+1}}
=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{f_{n+2}}{f_{n+1}}
=\phi
\]
<p>
Therefore, \(\phi\) is a fix-point of transformation \(x\mapsto 1+\frac 1x\).

<p>
Modify <code>fixed-point</code> so that it prints the sequence of approximations it
generates, using the <code>newline</code> and <code>display</code> primitives shown in exercise 1.22. Then
find a solution to \(x^x = 1000\) by finding a fixed point of \(x\to log(1000)/log(x)\).
(Use Scheme's primitive log procedure, which computes natural logarithms.)
Compare the number of steps this takes with and without average damping. (Note
that you cannot start <code>fixed-point</code> with a guess of 1, as this would cause
division by \(log(1) = 0\).)
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

</ul>
<p>
Fixed <code>fix-point</code>:
</p>
<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define TOL 0.00001)
(define (fix-point-display f first-guess)
    (define (close-enough? x next) (&gt; TOL (abs (- x next))))
    (define (report x) (display "Guessing ") (display x) (newline))
    (define (try x)

        (cond ((close-enough? x next) x)
              (else (report x) (try next)))))
    (try first-guess))
</pre>

<p>
And with first-guess set to 2.0, it takes 34 guess to the root of \(x^x=1000\),
while with the average damping takes 9 steps to the same root.

a. An infinite continued fraction is an expression of the form
</p>
\[
f=\cfrac{N_1}{D_1+\cfrac{N_2}{D_2+\cfrac{N_3}{D_3+\cdots}}}
\]
<p>
As an example, one can show that the infinite continued fraction expansion with
the \(N_i\) and the \(D_i\) all equal to 1 produces \(1/\phi\), where \(\phi\) is the golden ratio
(described in section 1.2.2). One way to approximate an infinite continued
fraction is to truncate the expansion after a given number of terms. Such
a truncation -- a so-called k-term finite continued fraction -- has the form
</p>
\[
a_k=\cftac{N_1}{N_1+\cfrac{N_2}{\ddots+\frac{N_k}{D_k}}}
\]
<p>
Suppose that <code>n</code> and <code>d</code> are procedures of one argument (the term index <code>i</code>) that
return the \(N_i\) and \(D_i\) of the terms of the continued fraction. Define a procedure
<code>cont-frac</code> such that evaluating <code>(cont-frac n d k)</code> computes the value of the
k-term finite continued fraction. Check your procedure by approximating \(1/\phi\)
using
</p>
<pre class="brush: scheme">

<p>
for successive values of <code>k</code>. How large must you make <code>k</code> in order to get an 
approximation that is accurate to 4 decimal places?
</p>

<p>
b. If your <code>cont-frac</code> procedure generates a recursive process, write one that
generates an iterative process. If it generates an iterative process, write one
that generates a recursive process. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Answer: 

</ul>
<p>
Only the iterative version

<code>k</code> needs to be last 12 to get 4 an approximation that is accurate to 4 decimal.

then the nth repeated application of \(f\) is the function \(x\mapsto x+n\). If \(f\) is the
operation of squaring a number, then the n-th repeated application of \(f\) is the

The idea of smoothing a function is an important concept in signal processing.

We saw in section 1.3.3 that attempting to compute square roots by naively
finding a fixed point of \(y\mapsto x/y\) does not converge, and that this can be fixed by
average damping. The same method works for finding cube roots as fixed points of
the average-damped \(y\mapsto x/y^2\). Unfortunately, the process does not work for fourth
roots -- a single average damp is not enough to make a fixed-point search for
\(y\mapsto x/y^3\) converge. On the other hand, if we average damp twice (i.e., use the
average damp of the average damp of \(y\mapsto x/y^3\)) the fixed-point search does
converge. Do some experiments to determine how many average damps are required
to compute \(n\)-th roots as a fixed-point search based upon repeated average damping
of \(y\mapsto x/y^{n-1}\). Use this to implement a simple procedure for computing \(n\)-th roots
using <code>fixed-point</code>, <code>average-damp</code>, and the <code>repeated</code> procedure of exercise 1.43.

Several of the numerical methods described in this chapter are instances of an
extremely general computational strategy known as iterative improvement.
Iterative improvement says that, to compute something, we start with an initial
guess for the answer, test if the guess is good enough, and otherwise improve
the guess and continue the process using the improved guess as the new guess.
Write a procedure <code>iterative-improve</code> that takes two procedures as arguments: a
method for telling whether a guess is good enough and a method for improving a
guess. <code>iterative-improve</code> should return as its value a procedure that takes a
guess as argument and keeps improving the guess until it is good enough.
Rewrite the <code>sqrt</code> procedure of section 1.1.7 and the <code>fixed-point</code> procedure of
section 1.3.3 in terms of <code>iterative-improve</code>`.
