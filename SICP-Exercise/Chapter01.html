Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators 
are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of 
the following procedure:
</p>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (&gt; b 0) + -) a b))

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

<ul>
<li>
When <code>(&gt; b 0)</code> evaluated true, <code>(a-plus-abs-b a b) </code> become <code>(- a b)</code>,
    since \(b &lt; 0\) , this means \(a+\left|b\right|\)

<li>
When <code>(&gt; b 0)</code> evaluated false, it is <code>(+ a b)</code> now, again, means 
    \(a+\left|b\right|\)

<h3 id="toc_1.1.5">Exercise 1.5</h3>

<p>
Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is
faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation.
He defines the following two procedures:
</p>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))
</pre>

<p>
Then he evaluates the expression
</p>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
(test 0 (p))
</pre>

<p>
What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order
evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses
normal-order evaluation? Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule
for the special form <code>if</code> is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or
applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first, and the result
determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.) 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

<ul>
<li>
In an interpreter uses applicative-order eval., <code>(test 0 (p))</code> will first be
    expanded to <code>(if (= 0 0) 0 p)</code>, then goes to its first branch and than the
    whole expression is evaluated to 0

<li>
But in an interpreter uses normal-order eval., <code>(test 0 (p))</code> will also be
    expanded to <code>(if (= 0 0) 0 p)</code>, but than, the interpreter try to expend
    the nested <code>(p)</code>, and found it should be expand to <code>(p)</code>. Again, the
    interpreter will still try to expand <code>p</code> here, so the whole evaluation will
    never terminate.

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Alyssa P. Hacker doesn't see why if needs to be provided as a special form.
"Why can't I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of <code>cond?</code>" she
asks. Alyssa's friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she
defines a new version of <code>if</code>: 
</p>
<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))
</pre>
<p>
Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:
</p>
<pre class="brush: scheme">
(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
5

(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
0
</pre>
<p>
Delighted, Alyssa uses <code>new-if</code> to rewrite the square-root program:
</p>
<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
           guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                     x)))
</pre>
<p>
What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots? Explain.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

</ul>

<p>
The computation of square will never terminate. In an normal-order interpreter,
the recursion will never end, as already seen in <a href="\#toc_1.2.5.html">previous</a>
exercise. Still, even in a applicative-order interpreter, use <code>new-if</code> will not
always ensure the recursion terminate.     
</p>

<p>
When the interpreter try to eval the <code>sqrt</code>, it will come across the `(new-if
(good-enough? ...) guess (sqrt-iter ...))`. Here, the interpreter will eval.
<code>(good-enough? ...)</code>, <code>guess</code>, <code>(sqrt-iter ...)</code> accordingly. And when
evaluating <code>iter-iter</code>, it will come across the new-if again. This means the
evaluation will never terminate.    
</p>

<p>
The difference between between the 'internal' <code>if</code> and the <code>new-if</code> is that the
internal <code>if</code> is a primitive instruction, its evaluation process differs from
normal procedure. <code>if</code> will evaluate <code>predicate</code> first, and then only evaluate
one of <code>then-clause</code> and <code>else-clause</code> on <code>predicate</code> result, which the <code>new-if</code>
failed when evaluating a recursive procedure.  
</p>

<h3 id="toc_1.1.7">Exercise 1.7</h3>

<p>
The <code>good-enough?</code> test used in computing square roots will not be very effective
for finding the square roots of very small numbers. Also, in real computers,
arithmetic operations are almost always performed with limited precision. This
makes our test inadequate for very large numbers. Explain these statements, with
examples showing how the test fails for small and large numbers. An alternative
strategy for implementing <code>good-enough?</code> is to watch how guess changes from one
iteration to the next and to stop when the change is a very small fraction of
the guess. Design a square-root procedure that uses this kind of end test. Does
this work better for small and large numbers?  
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

</ul>

<p>
Suppose we want to find the square root of 10<sup><small>10</small></sup>, which is 10<sup><small>5</small></sup>, the evaluation
go on like this: 
<table>
<tr>
<th>
guess
</th>
<th>
x/guess
</th>
<th>
avg.
</th>
<th>
abs(avg<sup><small>2</small></sup>-x)
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
1
</td>
<td>
1<sup><small>-10</small></sup>
</td>
<td>
1 + 5*10<sup><small>-11</small></sup>
</td>
<td>
nearly 10<sup><small>10</small></sup> - 1
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
1 + 5*10<sup><small>-11</small></sup>
</td>
<td>
0.999*10<sup><small>-10</small></sup>
</td>
<td>
1 + 9.99*10<sup><small>-11</small></sup>
</td>
<td>
nearly 10<sup><small>10</small></sup> - 1
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
...
</td>
<td>
...
</td>
<td>
...
</td>
<td>
...
</td>
</tr>
</table>
As we can see here, the evaluation converges slowly, in fact, it will <strong>never</strong>
converges since the difference <code>avg.</code> is always a number slightly large than 1,
and their difference is too small in comparison of 10<sup><small>10</small></sup> and may be rounded
off. So the eval will fail on large number.
</p>

<p>
The case with very small number is better, the evaluation will terminate, but
with a wrong value. This is mainly caused by the way with the definition of
<code>good-enough?</code>. When the <code>guess</code> itself is smaller than the threshold in
<code>good-enough?</code>, the iteration will terminate, whatever it is the proper square
root. 
</p>

<p>
Using change between two guess as the termination condition, the
<code>good-enugh?</code> may look like:
</p>
<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define TOL 0.00001)
(define (good-enough? old-guess guess)
        (if (= guess 0) 
            true
            (&lt; (abs (/ (- guess old-guess) guess)) TOL)))
</pre>
<p>
And <code>sqrt-iter</code> should modify accordingly:
</p>
<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
    ((define old-guess guess)
     (define new-guess (improve guess x)
        (if (good-enough? old-guess new-guess)
            old-guess
            (sqrt-iter new-guess x)))
</pre>
<p>
And this version of <code>good-enough?</code> will terminate on large number, with a wrong
answer, but good with small number. The poor condition with large number is
majorly the restriction of Newton's method, which means there nothing else to do
to improve the problem with large number without a better way to find the
initial guess value, other thane simply take 1.

<h3 id="toc_1.1.8">Exercise 2.8</h3>
<p>
Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if \(y\) is
an approximation to the cube root of \(x\), then a better approximation is given by
the value
</p>
\[
y^*=\frac{x/y^2 + 2y}{3}
\]
<p>
Use this formula to implement a <code>cube-root</code> procedure analogous to the square-root
procedure. (In section 1.3.4 we will see how to implement Newton's method in
general as an abstraction of these square-root and cube-root procedures.)

            (cube-iter (guess-next guess))))
    (define (good-enough? guess)

Prove that \(Fib(n)\) is the closest integer to \(\varphi^n/\sqrt{5}\), where

The induction definition of <code>Fibonacci numbers</code>, say \(Fib(n)=Fib(n-1)+Fib(n-2)\),

How many times is the procedure <code>p</code> applied when <code>(sine 12.15)</code> is evaluated?

<li>
What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of
  a) used by the process generated by the sine procedure when <code>(sine a)</code> is
  evaluated? 

</ol>

<ul>

Answer:

<ol>
<li>
Since each call of <code>p</code> will decrease the angle to its one-third, and 
    12.15 is 0.05*3<sup><small>5</small></sup>, in the evaluation of <code>(sine 12.15)</code>, <code>p</code> will be applied
    5 times.

The exponentiation algorithms in this section are based on performing
exponentiation by means of repeated multiplication. In a similar way, one can
perform integer multiplication by means of repeated addition. The following
multiplication procedure (in which it is assumed that our language can only add,
not multiply) is analogous to the <code>expt</code> procedure:
</p>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define (* a b)
  (if (= b 0)
      0
      (+ a (* a (- b 1)))))

This algorithm takes a number of steps that is linear in <code>b</code>. Now suppose we
include, together with addition, operations double, which doubles an integer,
and halve, which divides an (even) integer by 2. Using these, design
a multiplication procedure analogous to <code>fast-expt</code> that uses a logarithmic number
of steps.

<p>
There is a clever algorithm for computing the Fibonacci numbers in a logarithmic
number of steps. Recall the transformation of the state variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> in
the <code>fib-iter</code> process of section 1.2.2: \((a,a+b)\) and \((b,a)\). Call this
transformation \(T\), and observe that applying \(T\) over and over again n times,
starting with 1 and 0, produces the pair <code>Fib(n + 1)</code> and <code>Fib(n)</code>. In other
words, the Fibonacci numbers are produced by applying \(T^n\), the nth power of the
transformation \(T\), starting with the pair \((1,0)\). Now consider \(T\) to be the
special case of \(p=0\) and \(q=1\) in a family of transformations \(T_{pq}\), where
\(T_{pq}\) transforms the pair \((a,b)\) according to \((a,bq+aq+ap)\) and
\((b,bp+aq)\). Show that if we apply such a transformation \(T_{pq}\) twice, the
effect is the same as using a single transformation \(T_{p'q'}\) of the same form,
and compute \(p'\) and \(q'\) in terms of \(p\) and \(q\). This gives us an explicit way
to square these transformations, and thus we can compute Tn using successive
squaring, as in the <code>fast-expt</code> procedure. Put this all together to complete the
following procedure, which runs in a logarithmic number of steps:
</p>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
(define (fib n)

The process that a procedure generates is of course dependent on the rules used
by the interpreter. As an example, consider the iterative <code>gcd</code> procedure given
above. Suppose we were to interpret this procedure using normal-order
evaluation, as discussed in section 1.1.5. (The normal-order-evaluation rule for
if is described in exercise 1.5.) Using the substitution method (for normal
order), illustrate the process generated in evaluating <code>(gcd 206 40)</code> and indicate
the remainder operations that are actually performed. How many remainder
operations are actually performed in the normal-order evaluation of <code>(gcd 206 40)</code>? 
In the applicative-order evaluation? 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

</ul>

<pre class="brush: scheme">
; normal-order evaluation will expand the evaluation like this
(if (= 0 40)

Most Lisp implementations include a primitive called <code>runtime</code> that returns an
integer that specifies the amount of time the system has been running
(measured, for example, in microseconds). The following <code>timed-prime-test</code>
procedure, when called with an integer <code>n</code>, prints <code>n</code> and checks to see if <code>n</code> is
prime. If <code>n</code> is prime, the procedure prints three asterisks followed by the
amount of time used in performing the test.

Using this procedure, write a procedure <code>search-for-primes</code> that checks the
primality of consecutive odd integers in a specified range. Use your procedure
to find the three smallest primes larger than 1000; larger than 10,000; larger
than 100,000; larger than 1,000,000. Note the time needed to test each prime.
Since the testing algorithm has order of growth of \(O(\sqrt{n})\), you should expect that
testing for primes around 10,000 should take about 10 times as long as testing
for primes around 1000. Do your timing data bear this out? How well do the data
for 100,000 and 1,000,000 support the n prediction? Is your result compatible

The <code>smallest-divisor</code> procedure shown at the start of this section does lots of
needless testing: After it checks to see if the number is divisible by 2 there
is no point in checking to see if it is divisible by any larger even numbers.
This suggests that the values used for <code>test-divisor</code> should not be 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, ..., but rather 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, .... To implement this change, define
a procedure next that returns 3 if its input is equal to 2 and otherwise
returns its input plus 2. Modify the <code>smallest-divisor</code> procedure to use 
<code>(next test-divisor)</code> instead of <code>(+ test-divisor 1)</code>. With <code>timed-prime-test</code>
incorporating this modified version of <code>smallest-divisor</code>, run the test for each
of the 12 primes found in exercise 1.22. Since this modification halves the
number of test steps, you should expect it to run about twice as fast. Is this
expectation confirmed? If not, what is the observed ratio of the speeds of the
two algorithms, and how do you explain the fact that it is different from 2?

Is she correct? Would this procedure serve as well for our fast prime tester?

This version of <code>expmod</code> will indeed faster then original <code>expmod</code> with small
<code>base</code> and <code>exp</code>, for it shall only eval <code>remainder</code> once. But with a larger
<code>base</code> and/or <code>exp</code>, this <code>expmod</code> will much slower and may even yield the wrong
answer, simply for the <code>(fast-expt base exp)</code> will be quite a large number, so
either the calculation large number with precision involved here, which is known
to be very slow, or just simply overflowed, which leads to the wrong answer.

The original version of <code>expmod</code> do the <code>remainder</code> in each of its recursion, by
which prevent the occurrence of large number during the process of eval.

Louis Reasoner is having great difficulty doing exercise 1.24. His <code>fast-prime?</code>
test seems to run more slowly than his <code>prime?</code> test. Louis calls his friend Eva
Lu Ator over to help. When they examine Louis's code, they find that he has
rewritten the <code>expmod</code> procedure to use an explicit multiplication, rather than
calling square:
</p>

<pre class="bursh: scheme">
(define (expmod base exp m)
  (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
        ((even? exp)
         (remainder (* (expmod base (/ exp 2) m)
                       (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))
                    m))
        (else
         (remainder (* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m))
                    m))))

<p>
"I don't see what difference that could make," says Louis. "I do." says Eva.
"By writing the procedure like that, you have transformed the \(O(\log n)\) process
into a \(O(n)\) process." Explain. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Answer:

</ul>

<p>
The original <code>expmode</code> use <code>square</code> to reduce the calling of <code>expmode</code>, which
the modified version has failed. With an even base, the modified <code>expmod</code> will
call itself twice. By doing so, the modified <code>expmod</code> makes no difference than
simply multiply <code>base</code> with itself <code>exp</code> times, but with the overhead of
recursive calling, which makes the <code>prime?</code> even slower.

<p>
One variant of the Fermat test that cannot be fooled is called the 
<code>Miller-Rabin test</code> (Miller 1976; Rabin 1980). This starts from an alternate
form of <code>Fermat's Little Theorem</code>, which states that if \(n\) is a prime number and
\(a\) is any positive integer less than \(n\), then \(a\) raised to the \((n - 1)\)st power is
congruent to 1 modulo n. To test the primality of a number \(n\) by the <code>Miller-Rabin</code>
test, we pick a random number \(a &lt; n\) and raise \(a\) to the \((n - 1)\)st power modulo
\(n\) using the <code>expmod</code> procedure. However, whenever we perform the squaring step in
<code>expmod</code>, we check to see if we have discovered a "nontrivial square root of
1 modulo \(n\)," that is, a number not equal to 1 or \(n - 1\) whose square is equal to
1 modulo \(n\).  It is possible to prove that if such a nontrivial square root of
1 exists, then \(n\) is not prime. It is also possible to prove that if n is an odd
number that is not prime, then, for at least half the numbers a&lt;n, computing
an-1 in this way will reveal a nontrivial square root of 1 modulo n. (This is
why the Miller-Rabin test cannot be fooled.) Modify the <code>expmod</code> procedure to
signal if it discovers a nontrivial square root of 1, and use this to implement
the Miller-Rabin test with a procedure analogous to <code>fermat-test</code>. Check your
procedure by testing various known primes and non-primes. Hint: One convenient
way to make <code>expmod</code> signal is to have it return 0.
